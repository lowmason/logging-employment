# NOT Appendix A's fence. Measured against `specs/logging-employment-spec.md`'s `## Appendix A`
# block, this constant differs from it in four ways, every one of which is this package's doing
# rather than the spec's:
#   1. it OMITS `model:`, which `Config` defaults to `ModelConfig()` -- Appendix A's eleven values
#      plus the three keys plan 16 originated.
#   2. it OMITS `promotion:` and `validation:`, which `Config` defaults.
#   3. it ADDS five `reconciliation:` keys this package originated (`tolerance`,
#      `max_bisection_iterations`, `max_projection_iterations`, `zero_seed_floor`,
#      `integerization_tiebreak`).
#   4. it OMITS Appendix A's seven `enabled: false` sources.
# A fifth, that it ADDED `baselines:` and the two `disclosure:` narrow-interval widths, closed when
# `D-121` put all three into Appendix A with the values below. The name says so because the old
# one (`APPENDIX_A`) claimed to be the spec's example configuration and was not, which is how
# "Appendix A loads" stayed believable while the real fence produced eleven validation errors.
# `appendix_a_fence()` below reads the actual block.
