# it lands on the reason; it is deliberately not repeated in `src/`.)
# §13.10's coverage gate reads these intervals and cannot tell a time-ordered interval from this
# one, so the name is the only thing carrying the distinction. Unlike WEIGHT_BASES and its five
# siblings above (STRATUM_KINDS joined them in R-S5G-1), this tuple is enforced by nothing at
# runtime — `assert_declared_provenance` does not cover `interval_source` — so
# `tests/integration/test_validation_golden.py` is its only check.
# Renaming the value here does not build the rolling version; that is Stage 5's, per
# `specs/completed/stage5-preconditions.md` §4.
INTERVAL_SOURCES: tuple[str, ...] = ("leave_one_out_residual_ensemble", "none")

# One row per (regime, seed, replicate, estimator, cell): the raw scored observations, including
# the ones that were declined. Distinct in grain from VALIDATION_METRIC_SCHEMA below, and
# conflating the two is how R-COMP-10's denominator gets lost.
#
# `replicate` is the INDEX OF THE SEED in `config.validation.pseudo_suppression_seeds`, so it is
# 1:1 with `seed` on any single run and the two together are one key rather than two. It is carried
# anyway because `pseudo_suppression_seeds` is configurable and a reader comparing two runs needs
# the slot as well as the value. `replicates_per_regime` is a DIFFERENT number: it sizes the mask
# (`regimes.sample_targets`), not this loop's trip count.
#
# The last six are the PROVENANCE columns `run_baselines` already writes and this schema used to
# omit, which is what made a scored row auditable and the declaration wrong at the same time. They
# are declared rather than dropped (R-S4C-14). `constraint_set_hash` and
# `masked_constraint_set_hash` are BOTH here and are different columns: the first rides in from
# `run_baselines`, the second is the hash of the masked system this replicate solved. Neither is a
# rename of the other and neither may be dropped as a duplicate. NOTE that `run_baselines` does not
# populate the first on this path — measured 2026-09-09, `constraint_set_hash` is null on all
# 12,530 D1 scored rows while `masked_constraint_set_hash` is non-null on all of them. It is
# declared because R-S4C-14 declares what is produced rather than dropping it, and it is
# deliberately absent from VALIDATION_REQUIRED_NON_NULL below; do not read it as a join key.

#
# SCOPE, stated because the obvious reading overreaches. `validate_frame` compares columns and
# dtypes, and `dict[str, pl.DataType]` has no nullability slot — so this is a second, narrower
# declaration beside the schemas rather than an extension of them. Adding nullability to every
# schema in this module is explicitly out of scope.
#
# Each list holds only columns that are non-null BY CONSTRUCTION, not columns that merely happen to
# be non-null on a measured run. The test is whether the join that supplies the column is TOTAL by
# construction, NOT merely whether it is a LEFT join. `selected_lower` and `bound_status` are absent
# because they arrive through a LEFT join on `cell_id` from a frame that need not carry every cell,
# so their nullability is a property of the data. `n_own_estimator` and `n_establishment_fallback`
# ARE listed even though they too arrive through a LEFT join (`scoreboard.build_scoreboard`, on
# `regime`/`seed`/`estimator_id`), because the `declines` family emits exactly one row per
# (regime, seed, estimator_id) — the board's own grain — so that join cannot miss. Corrected
# 2026-09-09: the earlier wording gave "arrives through a LEFT join" as the criterion, which would
# have excluded those two as well.
# `weight_basis` is absent because a declining row has no weight to describe.
# `metric_name` is absent because the `declines` family emits counts rather than one named metric
# and writes null there on every row — measured 2026-09-08, 70 of 70 on the committed fixture.
# That is the same shape as the `mask_arm` defect this table exists to close, and it is RECORDED
# rather than fixed: naming that metric would move a second column of the golden.
# `wape` is absent because an estimator that declined every cell has no error, not zero error.

    The case that motivated this shipped: `validation_metrics` IS gated by `validate_frame`, and

    produced, because it checks columns and dtypes and not nullity.

    An unknown `name` RAISES rather than passing. A silent pass would let a caller believe a table
    was gated when the gate had nothing to say about it, which is the same class of quiet success
    this stage refuses everywhere else.

    ABSENCE IS CHECKED, NOT SKIPPED, and the function is named for it. An earlier version tested
