"""The substitute allocation anchor, and the gate that admits it.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. §12.2 defines the residual `R_t = N_t - sum_{s in D_t} E^obs` for a
compatible national total N_t. Until `D-120` (2026-09-26) it never said what *compatible* meant;
it now states the contract this module implements. §5.5 lists the ten dimensions that MUST be
evaluated before a source value is used. Nine match by construction here, because
N_t and the state rows are the same field of the same QCEW file: reference period; industry code
and NAICS vintage (one §5.5 bullet, not two); ownership coverage; employment concept; statistical
unit; size concept; release vintage and revision status; disclosure and noise regime -- both rows
come from one BLS disclosure regime, and that the national cell survives suppression while many
state cells do not is that regime operating as designed, not a difference in it; and exact rather
than rounded, sampled, or modeled values. The tenth, the geography universe, is exactly what
`closure_audit` measures.

WHAT THE GATE TESTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It tests the *universe*, not the *measure*. National
`qtrly_establishments` minus the sum over all published state rows -- including the
employment-suppressed ones, which still publish establishment counts -- must be exactly 0. Gap-0
closure forces every absent area to contribute zero establishments, and a QCEW area with zero
establishments classified into the industry has no covered jobs under §3.2's estimand. It does NOT
verify the employment identity; `SRC-QCEW-006`'s `decline` stands and this module does not rescue
it.

HONEST CAVEAT. `qtrly_establishments` is constant within a state-quarter, so a per-month gate
re-tests each quarterly value three times. A contamination confined to one month inside a quarter
is undetectable by construction. The gate is quarterly-resolution evidence wearing a monthly
shape, and it is recorded per month only because the residual is monthly.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. The anchor is a `modeling_assumption` (INV-004), never a constraint row. No row
is built, `assert_no_national_employment_margin` stays in force unqualified, and INV-005 keeps a
modeling assumption out of the deterministic feasible set. The adding-up restriction to R_t does
imply E_{s,t} <= R_t on every imputed cell -- a restriction the deterministic engine does not
have -- but that ceiling is DERIVED FROM A PUBLISHED NUMBER, not synthesized from a percentile or
a threshold guess, which is what distinguishes it from §9.3's "arbitrary top-class caps". It must
never be written back into `deterministic_bounds`.

RETIREMENT CONDITION. If a future QCEW vintage ever yields a month with no suppressed state cell,
`SRC-QCEW-006` becomes testable on that month, and `assert_universe_closes` then refuses a nonzero
residual there, halting the run (D-123). A pass raises nothing and is recorded only as that month's
audit row. Retiring this anchor in favour of the verified identity -- rather than keeping both and
letting them disagree silently -- is the decision to take when such a month first appears.
