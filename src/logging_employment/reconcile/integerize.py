"""§12.6 balanced integerization.

"Integerization MUST NOT be applied independently cell by cell." That sentence is the module's
reason to exist: three cells at 3.4 rounded independently give 9, and the margin they were
reconciled to is gone. The units are allocated against the margin instead -- floor everything,
count what is left, and hand the remainder out by largest fractional part.

THE TIE-BREAK MUST BE DETERMINISTIC. §16.1 requires every command to be idempotent for the same
inputs. Ties are common here because reconciled allocations of equal-weight cells are exactly
equal, so a tie-break by dict order, hash order, or anything unordered would make two runs of the
same data disagree on which cell got the extra job. Ties break by `cell_id` ascending. That
hardcoded ordering IS `ReconciliationConfig.integerization_tiebreak = 'largest_remainder'`; the
function takes no config argument, because the field's `Literal` admits exactly one value and a
parameter would imply a choice that does not exist.

BOUNDS ARE READ PER CELL THAT HAS A VALUE. Iterating the `upper` dict instead let a cap for a cell
with no value create an entry, which lowered `base` and corrupted the real cells' allocation; and
a `lower` above an `upper` was silently resolved in the cap's favour, returning a value below the
bound the caller declared. Both are refused or ignored now rather than absorbed. The remainder
that orders the round-robin is measured from the floor actually used, because a floor raised by
`lower` has already consumed the cell's fractional claim.

THE PLACEMENT BUDGET IS COMPUTED ONCE. It bounds how many index steps the round-robin may take,
and it must be fixed before the loop starts. Evaluating `len(order) * (remaining + 1)` inside the
loop condition recomputes it against a `remaining` that falls with every placement, so the ceiling
descends toward the climbing index and the loop can exit with units still in hand -- reporting an
infeasible margin on inputs that are perfectly feasible, which defeats the only reason `upper`
exists.

    Every refusal is `InfeasibleResidualError`, the integer half of the question §12.3's scaling
    answers for floats, but the three do not prove the same thing. A `lower` above an `upper` and a
    remainder the caps cannot absorb each leave no integer allocation inside the bounds that sums
    to `total`. The first is not only a caller's slip: `baselines.runner.integer_bounds` cuts a
    float interval holding no integer, such as [41.2, 41.9], to a lower of 42 and an upper of 41.
    The base check proves less. It refuses when the seats -- each cell's floor, raised to its lower
    bound -- sum past `total`, and a floor is not a bound: `{"a": 1.01, "b": 1.01, "c": 5.98}` at
    `total=8` with `lower={"a": 2, "b": 2}` seats 2, 2 and 5 and is refused, though 2, 2 and 4
    satisfies every bound.
