"""§12.3 bounded proportional scaling, solved by bisection.

E_{s,t} = clip(lambda * q_{s,t}, L_{s,t}, U_{s,t}), for the lambda making sum_{M_t} E = R_t.

WHY BISECTION AND NOT A ROOT FINDER. §12.3 names it: "Because the summed clipped allocation is
monotone in lambda, use robust bisection." Monotonicity is the whole reason the method is safe --
the clipped sum is a non-decreasing piecewise-linear function of lambda with flat segments where
every cell is clipped, and Newton or a secant method stalls on exactly those flats.
`test_the_clipped_sum_is_monotone_in_lambda` pins the property the choice rests on.

WHY NULL UPPERS ARE INFINITE. A null `selected_upper` means no public fact bounds the cell above.
On D1 that is true of every suppressed state cell without a published private `113` parent: plan
15 made that parent a constraint row, and `SRC-QCEW-006` came back `decline`, so nothing else bounds
a state cell. `None` maps to `math.inf`, which makes the clip's upper arm a no-op for such a cell,
and every D1 month's missing set holds at least one, so the `sum U < R_t` half of §12.3's predicate
cannot fire there. Coercing null to a large finite number instead
would invent the "arbitrary top-class cap" §9.3 forbids by name, and would silently change results
whenever the chosen number happened to bind.
