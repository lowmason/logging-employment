# `harmonize/disclosure.CBP_REGIME_BY_YEAR`, which is a module constant keyed by reference year
# for the same reason. Deliberately NOT derived from that table, even though 2024 is missing from
# both: "Census publishes no dataset" and "no fetched documentation states a disclosure regime"
# are two findings that happen to coincide on one year, and a year published with an undocumented
# regime must 200 here and halt in `harmonize`, not be excused from being fetched at all.
