    Every field the API returns about disclosure is preserved rather than collapsed into a
    boolean, and `reference_period` is stamped `week_including_march_12` because a CBP employment
    value is a March-centered measurement, not a QCEW identity.

    `disclosure_status` is derived from `EMP_F`, not from whether `EMP` is null. The 2017 state
    record layout defines EMPFLAG as the "Data Suppression Flag" and says a withheld cell has its
    "Employment or payroll field set to zero", and the 2017 extract bears that out: every flagged
    row publishes `EMP` as the literal `0` against three live establishments. Reading those as
    published zeros would make a suppression-coded value a true zero, which INV-003 forbids, so a
    withheld row's `employment` is null and its raw flag survives in `employment_flag`.

    A null `EMP` is also treated as withheld. No row in either window fixture has one, so that
    branch is documented-not-measured; it is the conservative reading, since a value CBP did not
    publish is certainly not a published one.

    `disclosure_status` cannot report a *dropped* cell. From reference year 2017 CBP omits a cell
    with fewer than three establishments from the release entirely, so a dropped cell is an absent
    row rather than a row carrying a status, and the absence is only visible against an expected
    key list -- which is a harmonize-layer concern, not this parser's.

    `employment_noise_range` carries `EMP_N` verbatim. Stage 0 measured that column as the literal
    string `'0'` on every row of all eight window years: the per-cell noise-magnitude flag is
    `EMP_N_F`, which `build_query` selects and which no Stage 0 response contained. The column is
    therefore preserved, not interpreted.
