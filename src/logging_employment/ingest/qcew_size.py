    Every row is stamped with March of the reference year. That is not a convenience:
    SRC-QSIZE-001 requires the March classification definition to survive into the table, and the
    file itself is first-quarter-only, so a row that lost its March stamp could not be recovered
    from the data.

    The dimensionality check runs here rather than being left to a caller, because SRC-QSIZE-002
    binds *the parser*: a guarantee only the test suite invokes is not one the build path has.

    `observation_status` is binary. `qcew_monthly` needs a true-zero rule because suppressed and
    genuinely-zero cells both publish `0`; measured on the shipped fixture, no row this parser
    emits carries zero establishments, so that case does not arise here. A test pins the
