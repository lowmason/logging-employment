"""QCEW quarterly acquisition over both published routes, and the monthly parser.

D5 makes acquisition dual-route: the Open Data CSV slice endpoint and the downloadable bulk
files, behind one interface, selected by reference year. The boundary between them is measured
each run rather than stored. Stage 0 probed the slice route across candidate years and recorded
the earliest year it served as a status observed in one run rather than a property of the route,
so no year appears here as a literal -- `probe_slice_boundary` re-measures it and the run manifest
records what that run found.
