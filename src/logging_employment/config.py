    same QCEW product on the same route, so `fetching.py` fetches it with the `qcew` client and its
    own industry constant, and it adds nothing to `resolved_dict`.

    Appendix A's `sources:` block lists ten. Seven of them -- `tpo`, `fia`, `ces`, `susb`, `bds`,
    `nonemployer`, `bea` -- carry `enabled: false` and belong to Stages 4-8; before they were
    declared here, `extra="forbid"` made the spec's own reference configuration unloadable, which
    is `R-S5P-6`'s defect (`specs/completed/stage5-preconditions.md`) and what this fixes. `R-S5P-6` scoped
    only these seven. Appendix A's `model:` block is still left failing on purpose, and
    `tests/unit/test_config.py` asserts it is the only thing that fails; the fence's three MISSING

    They are declared as fields rather than admitted by `extra="allow"`
    so that a MISSPELLED source name is still a load-time error and so that `enabled: true` on an
    unimplemented source is refused (`InactiveSourceConfig`); `extra="allow"` would have accepted
    both silently.

    EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN IS `exclude=True`, so none of them reaches `resolved_dict` and none can
    move a run id. That is deliberate and load-bearing, not a serialization detail: `runs.run_id`
    hashes `resolved_dict`, and a source that is `enabled: false` contributes no bytes to any

    ALL THREE KEYS ARE INERT TODAY, and this note is the record R-S5G-3 requires rather than a
    disclaimer. Each reaches `config.resolved.yaml` and folds into `runs.run_id`, so an unread key
    is a claim in a run's record that no code backs -- the defect `D-064` names for four other
    keys. The convention there is to write inertness into the code (`constraints/matrix.py`'s "NO
    REAL INPUT UNTIL STAGE 6", `errors.py::NoHarvestFactorError`), which is what this is.

    They are inert for TWO different reasons, and the distinction is the useful half:

    - `maximum_major_stratum_wape_degradation` and `nominal_coverage_tolerance` have their INPUT as
      of R-S5G-1. `validate/metrics.py` now emits a per-census-division WAPE and a per-division
      90% coverage into `validation_metrics.parquet`, so both gates are evaluable from a shipped
      artifact. The coverage values `nominal_coverage_tolerance` would gate on carried a
      residual-sign defect until `D-112` (fixed 2026-09-12, `19fbdec`); one written before that fix
      must be regenerated before any gate reads it. What is missing is the CANDIDATE to evaluate: §13.10 compares a model against the
      preferred transparent baseline and Stage 5 produces the model.
    - `minimum_wape_improvement` is missing both. Its comparison needs a second scoreboard, and
      `validation_scoreboard.parquet` exists in one copy -- the baseline one.

    NO EVALUATOR IS BUILT HERE, deliberately. A function whose primary argument is Stage 5's
    not-yet-designed output would fix that signature by guessing it, and three of §13.10's six
    gates (hard constraints on draws, convergence diagnostics, disclosure review) are Stage-5 and
    Stage-8 concepts an evaluator written now could not represent at all. Stage 5 wires these;
    `tests/unit/test_config_validation_block.py` fails the day `src/` code names one of the keys --
    as an attribute, a string, a parameter or a keyword argument, `config.py` itself included -- so
    this docstring cannot quietly outlive that truth. A reader that never spells a key exactly -- a
    generic `model_dump()` loop, or a dotted path string such as `attrgetter("promotion.<key>")` --
    would not trip it; update this note by hand in that case.
