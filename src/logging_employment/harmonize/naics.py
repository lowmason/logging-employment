"""NAICS vintage handling and the mechanical 113310 crosswalk across the D1 window.

The crosswalk rows are vendored in `naics_113310.csv` from the classification-codes skill's derived
NAICS data. Two caveats travel with them, recorded by the Stage 0 audit and repeated here because
they bound what this module's passing test proves:

* `link_type = 1:1` is derived from code multiplicities after deduplication; it is **not a Census
  column**. Census ships four columns -- source code, source title, target code, target title --
  flags partial flows through cell formatting that a plain parse discards, and publishes no
  allocation weights.
* 1:1 establishes only that 113310 neither split nor merged in the six-digit code pairing. That is
  not a statement about the industry's definitional content. The unchanged title and the empty
  structure-file `change_indicator` are what carry the continuity claim, and even those are titles
  and markers rather than a comparison of the two vintages' definitional text.

# The QCEW vintage boundary Stage 0 recorded: NAICS 2017 for reference years 2017-2021, NAICS 2022
# from 2022 on. QCEW publishes no per-row vintage column, so this mapping is documented rather than
# measured. CITED 2026-09-08 -- Stage 0 carried the supporting premise as uncited and routed a
# citation to a later stage; this is that citation. BLS publishes the reference-year-to-vintage
# mapping directly, and states it in the present tense, which is what makes it load-bearing here:
# 2017-2021 are STILL on NAICS 2017 four years after NAICS 2022 was introduced, so prior reference
# years are not recoded onto a new vintage.
#
#   "Data from 1990-2006 are classified under the NAICS 2002 system. (Data from 1990-2000 were
#    originally classified under the 1987 SIC. As a NAICS reconstruction project, the data had
#    been reclassified under the NAICS 2002) Data from 2007-2010 are classified under the NAICS
#    2007 system. Data from 2011-2016 are classified under the NAICS 2012 system. Data from
#    2017-2021 are classified under the NAICS 2017 system. Data from 2022-forward will be
#    classified under the NAICS 2022 system."
#   -- BLS QCEW Q&A, "What versions of NAICS and SIC does the QCEW program use?",
#      https://www.bls.gov/cew/questions-and-answers.htm (last modified 2026-02-13). The same
#      mapping appears on https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/home.htm (last modified
#      2026-01-28), so it does not rest on a single page.
#
# ONE QUALIFICATION, from that same BLS answer, recorded because omitting it would make the
# citation cherry-picked: QCEW HAS retabulated history, once. That is the parenthetical above --
# 1990-2000 "had been reclassified under the NAICS 2002" -- a one-time bridge across
# classification SYSTEMS (SIC to NAICS), announced as its own project. So the unqualified
# claim "QCEW does not retabulate prior reference years" is false as stated. The operative claim
# this module rests on -- no NAICS-vintage-to-NAICS-vintage recode -- is the one BLS supports, and
# BLS says so plainly when it does retabulate, which is why the silence elsewhere carries weight.
#
# SCOPE, and the guard below. The two-branch rule is correct only at or above 2017. BLS's table
# puts 2011-2016 on NAICS 2012 and 2007-2010 on NAICS 2007, so before this guard existed every
# year below 2017 was stamped "NAICS 2017" -- a year BLS classifies otherwise.
#
# A pre-2017 year is REFUSED rather than classified from the table below, because this package can
# name a pre-2017 vintage but cannot consume one. `crosswalk_113310` vendors only the 2017 and
# 2022 rows and `assert_113310_survives_the_window` requires exactly that pair; `validate/regimes`
# DOCUMENTS the single seam 2021-12/2022-01 and derives its targets from it -- prose and a derived
# column, not an assertion, so it would not fail on a third vintage; `baselines/historical`
# filters its lookback on `naics_vintage` equality, so a third string would quietly shrink every
# lookback rather than fail. `naics_vintage` also composes into `cell_id` (`constraints/cells.py`)
# and is declared by five `contracts.py` schemas. Emitting "NAICS 2012" would therefore be right
# as a BLS fact and wrong as a pipeline value -- the same trade `build.py` already makes when it
# refuses to let an unestablished CBP disclosure regime reach a harmonized table.
#
# ONLY THE LOWER END IS GUARDED. BLS says "2022-forward", so "NAICS 2022" is source-justified for
# every year above the window. NAICS 2027 will end that, but nothing published contradicts the
# rule yet, and guarding forward would refuse a window extension BLS's own table supports.
#
# THE BOUND IS NOT DERIVED FROM `constants.WINDOW_START`, though both read 2017 today. It is the
# first year of BLS's NAICS 2017 era -- a fact about BLS's table, where the window is a fact about
# D1. Deriving it from the window would make widening the window widen the accepted range in the
# same edit, silently restoring the defect this guard exists to stop. Reachability is why that
# matters: `fetching.py` builds its years from `cfg.project.start_month`, which `ProjectConfig`
# validates only as `YYYY-MM`, so the window is a config value and not this constant.

# BLS's published table, recorded so a widening does not have to re-source it. Each pair is the
# first reference year of that vintage's era, and every one of the five now traces to the
# quotation above -- the two entries below 2011 included, which is what that passage was extended
# to cover. Used ONLY to tell a refused caller what BLS says -- never to emit a value. Wiring it
# to the return is not a one-line change: it also needs crosswalk
# rows for the new vintage, a `validate/regimes` seam that is no longer single, and a decision
# about `cell_id` values that have never existed. A test pins it equal to the live rule across
# 2017-2024 so the documentation cannot drift from the behaviour where both apply.
