    §8.6's closing line binds every caller: no bridge may be introduced solely to force totals to
    agree. A bridge whose `method` is a reconciliation step rather than a concept mapping does not
    belong in this table.

    A row missing a declared field raises `SchemaMismatchError` (`D-140`). Polars would render
    the absent field as null, and a
    bridge carrying a null `verification_status` or `uncertainty_treatment` states nothing about
    whether the mapping was estimated or merely declared -- which is the one thing §8.6 asks a
    bridge row to say.
