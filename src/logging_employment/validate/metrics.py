    The weight-basis half is not redundant. Plan 10's `BreakAdjustedShare` refusals reuse the
    `None` path, so the cell is COMPOSED onto the §10.2 fallback rather than declined: it carries
    `weight_basis = 'establishment_fallback'` and NO `decline_kind`. A report built from decline
    counts alone therefore shows §10.3 variant 5 as fully covered. Measured on D1,
    `share_break_adjusted` is 226 own / 1,001 fallback against its three siblings' 327/900.

    `arm` matches the four sibling emitters. Without it this family wrote a NULL `mask_arm` on
    every row it produced — 70 of 70 on the committed fixture, 270 of 270 on D1, against zero nulls
    in each of the other four families — and that null was persisted in `validation_metrics`
    without ever failing `validate_frame`. The damage stops at that table: `build_scoreboard`'s
    `basis` frame selects only (`regime`, `seed`, `estimator_id`, `n_own_estimator`,
    `n_establishment_fallback`) and drops `mask_arm` before the join, so the board takes its
    `mask_arm` from the point rows alone, where it is non-null on all 350 of them. (1,168 is the
    whole golden table, on which `mask_arm` WAS null 70 times before this parameter existed — those
    70 were exactly this family's rows, which is the defect, not a counterexample to it. The
    committed golden was regenerated when `arm` landed and now has zero nulls; the diff was
    inspected first and `mask_arm` was the only column that moved.)
