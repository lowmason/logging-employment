# logging-employment

Monthly state Logging (NAICS 113310) employment by establishment
size class, with deterministic bounds on the suppressed cells.

## Usage

### Deterministic identification (Stage 2)

    logging-estimates build-constraints --config config.yaml
    logging-estimates solve-bounds --config config.yaml

`build-constraints` writes `data/constraints/` and a run directory under `runs/`;
`solve-bounds` writes `deterministic_bounds.parquet`, `component_rank.parquet` and
`disclosure_flags.parquet` beside it. Both are idempotent: the run id is derived from the
resolved configuration and the harmonized inputs, so re-running lands on the same directory.

On the pilot window the engine bounds 14 suppressed national size classes to intervals 130–894
employees wide. `SRC-QCEW-006` came back `decline`, so no national employment margin constrains a
state cell, but a published private `113` parent does: on the 2026-09-13 re-run 756 of the
1227 suppressed state-month cells carry that parent as a finite upper bound and 471 stay
`unbounded` (`specs/findings/qcew-parent-margins.md`, `specs/findings/stage-5-log.md`).
Stages 3–5 are what narrow the rest.
